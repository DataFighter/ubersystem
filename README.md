The UberSystem
=======

UberSystem is a webapp that an event can use to track things like registration, events, staffers, groups, dealers, jobs, game checkouts, etc.

This app was originally developed by [MAGFest](http://magfest.org) as our internal registration system, and is now open source and available for anyone to use.

MAGFest has been running UberSystem for years so this code has been put through it's paces.  We are doing lots of work to make UberSystem more customizable for other events to use it.

If you are another event wanting to use UberSystem for production purposes, definitely get in touch with us and we'll help you get it going.  email us at "code at magfest dot org"

Installation / Development
